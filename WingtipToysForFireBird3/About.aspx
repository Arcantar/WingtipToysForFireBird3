    <h3>WingtipToys For FireBird3 with <a href="http://www.elementscompiler.com/elements/oxygene" >Oxygene Element (Rem Objects)</a></h3>
    <p>This project was born of a lack of functioning examples of Oxygene language possibilities in the world ASP Web Form (here with Framework 4.6) coupled to <a href="http://www.firebirdsql.org">SQL Firebird 3.0</a>. "For WingtipToys FireBird3" also incorporates <a href="https://github.com/Arcantar/AspNet.Identity.Firebird3">OWIN authentication (OAuth) for Firebird 3.0</a>  with identification Form, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft.</p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/Arcantar/WingtipToysForFireBird3" >"WingtipToys For FireBird3"</a> also implements a "cart" function via PayPal Express Checkout on the demo site, so you can buy these wonderful images that you will receive by email upon receipt of your payment :-) </p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/Arcantar/WingtipToysForFireBird3" >"WingtipToys For FireBird3"</a> is based on sources from <a href="https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Getting-Started-with-221c01f5" >Microsoft Wingtip Toys</a> project written in C#, designed closest possible to the original version. Currently in the "raw" state even if already in demo here http://wingtiptoysforfirebird3.tetrasys.fi . </p>
    <p>The project will evolve progressively based on your comments or specific needs.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Our sponsor for this development is the Finnish company <a href="http://tetrasys.fi" >TetraSys Oy</a> </p>
